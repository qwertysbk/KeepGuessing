# KeepGuessing

## Guessing Game Documentation
This is a simple guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number or an assigned number. The game provides a user interface using the tkinter library in Python.

## Game Rules  

- The user is prompted to guess a number between 0 and 100.  

- After each guess, the game provides feedback to the user whether the guessed number is correct,
greater than the target number, or lesser than the target number.  

- The user continues guessing until they correctly guess the number.   

- Once the correct number is guessed, a message box appears showing the number of trials taken by the user to guess correctly.  

- The user can choose to play again by clicking the "Yes" button or exit the game by clicking the "No" button.  

## User Interface
The game's UI is created using the tkinter library. It uses labels, buttons, and entry fields to interact with the user.  
mintuThe UI elements are positioned using the pack(), place(), and grid() methods of tkinter.
